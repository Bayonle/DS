Arrays are data structure that stores a collection of values where each value is referenced by an index or a key
Arrays is a contigous data structure which means arrays are stored blocks in memory that are right next to each other
Arrays in c# are homogenous in structure i.e they can only contain the same type
Accessing array values should happen in constant time i.e O(1)

Basic operations
    Access and read values
    Search for an arbitrary value 
    Insert values at any point into the structure
    Delte values in the structure
